        <p><strong>Health</strong></p>
        <p>The Federal  Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program is governed by 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89 and  regulated by Title 5, Chapter 1, Parts 890-891 of the CFR. Under the FEHB,  federal employees, retirees, and their survivors enjoy the widest selection of  health plans in the country. The FEHB program consists of different types of  plans: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fee-for-Service  with a Preferred Provider Organization</li>
          <li>Health  Maintenance Organizations</li>
          <li>Point of  Service</li>
          <li>High  Deductible Health Plans</li>
          <li>Consumer Driven  Health Plans</li>

			<p><strong>Dental and Vision</strong></p>
            
            <p>The Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 provided OPM the opportunity to establish arrangements under which supplemental dental and vision benefits are made available to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. As a result of this Act, the Federal Employees Dental/Vision Program (FEDVIP) was established. Through FEDVIP, eligible employees and annuitants can choose from a number of nationwide and regional dental and vision plans that provide additional coverage beyond coverage offered by most health plans. </p>

            <p>The Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) is the largest group life insurance program in the world, covering over 4 million employees, retirees, and family members. FEGLI provides group term life insurance consisting of basic life insurance coverage and three options providing additional coverage. </p>

			<p><strong>Flexible Spending Accounts</strong></p>
			<p>The Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) allows eligible employees to set aside money for health care and dependent care expenses. The money contributed to FSAFEDS accounts is set aside before taxes are deducted, which typically provides a savings on federal taxes. The Health Care or Limited Expense Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) can be used by enrollees to pay for items that aren’t covered by their FEHB plan, FEDVIP plan, or other health insurance coverage. The Dependent Care FSA allows enrollees to set aside money to pay for expenses related to the care of young children or elder care.</p>

			<p><strong>Long Term Care</strong></p>
			<p>The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) provides long-term care insurance to help pay for costs of care when enrollees need help with activities they perform every day or have a severe cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). Most federal and U.S. Postal Service employees and annuitants, active and retired members of the uniformed services, and their qualified relatives are eligible to apply for insurance coverage under FLTCIP.</p>
