<p>Monitoring involves consistently measuring performance and providing ongoing feedback to employees and work groups on their progress toward reaching their goals. Regulatory requirements for monitoring performance include conducting progress reviews with employees where their performance is compared against their elements and standards. Supervisors should monitor employee progress, not only when there is a progress review due, but on a continuous basis throughout the appraisal period. Monitoring gives the supervisor an opportunity to make a course correction or adjust a timeline if it is needed so that employees will produce the desired outcome of successfully achieving the agency's or work unit's goals. It also provides the opportunity for the supervisor to make employees aware of their progress, whether favorable or unacceptable. Should the supervisor determine the employee has unacceptable performance on any critical element, monitoring performance enables the supervisor to identify the problem early and get an opportunity period in place well before the rating of record is due.</p>
