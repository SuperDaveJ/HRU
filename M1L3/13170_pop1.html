<p>Performance coaching  and feedback help managers and executives support a high-performance culture.</p>
<p>The purposes of  performance coaching and feedback are to help managers improve the productivity  of their employees, to develop and improve an employee's capability to perform,  and to correct poor performance.</p>
<p>The relationship  between managers and their employees is initiated by performance-related  conversations that are continued through the duration of the working  partnership. </p>
<p>Effective  application of performance coaching and feedback will result in better  achievement of agency strategic goals, as well as professional growth for both  managers and employees.</p>
<p>As an HR  professional, you serve a key role in this competency by providing resources to  managers and supervisors to help them improve their performance coaching and  feedback skills.</p>
