<p>Veterans' preference  recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country  in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for  government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled  veterans.</p>
<p>Veterans' preference  in its present form comes from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, as amended,  and is now codified in various provisions of title 5, United States Code. In  addition to receiving preference for competitive appointments, some  noncompetitive appointments are also available to certain veterans.</p>
<p>Eligible veterans  (those who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during  certain specified time periods—during a war, in military campaigns, or in  expeditions for which a campaign badge has been authorized)—are entitled to  preference over others in hiring from competitive lists of eligibles and also  in retention during reductions in force.</p>
<p>Only veterans  discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable  conditions are eligible for veterans' preference. This means veterans must have  been discharged under an honorable or general discharge. Veterans&rsquo; preference  also includes spouses, widows, widowers, and parents of deceased or disabled  veterans when the veteran cannot use his/her preference. </p>
<p>A &quot;retired  member of the armed forces&quot; is not included in the definition of  preference eligible unless he or she is a disabled veteran OR retired below the  rank of major or its equivalent.</p>

<p>Veterans' preference  does not guarantee veterans a job, and it does not apply to internal agency  actions such as promotions, transfers, reassignments, or reinstatements. </p>
