<p>Developing involves  increasing employees&rsquo; capacity to perform through training, giving assignments  that introduce new skills or higher levels of responsibility, improving work  processes, or other methods. Providing employees with training and  developmental opportunities encourages good performance, strengthens job-related  skills and competencies, and helps employees keep up with changes in the  workplace. Supervisors should be able to determine from continuous monitoring  whether employees need additional development to achieve their assigned  responsibilities. It is important to remember that employee development  includes not only remediation but enhancing good performance as well. Types of  development may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Formal training (classroom)</li>
  <li>Informal training (online)</li>
  <li>Coaching or mentoring</li>
  <li>New work assignments (additional  responsibilities)</li>
  <li>Details  (within current agency or to an outside agency)</li>
</ul>
