<p>Appointments to the  excepted service are civil service appointments within the federal government  that have been excepted from typical competitive hiring processes via statute,  Executive Order, or by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  action.Â </p>
<p>Excepted service  positions in the executive branch may or may not be subject to the provisions  of title 5 U.S.C. There are a number of ways to be appointed to the excepted  service such as being appointed under an authority defined by OPM as excepted  (e.g., Veterans Recruitment Appointment) or being appointed to a position  defined by OPM as excepted (e.g., Attorneys).</p>
<p>Positions in the  legislative and judicial branches are in the excepted service unless they are  specifically included in the competitive service (e.g., the Government Printing  Office, an agency within the legislative branch, has positions in the  competitive service).</p>
