<p>The Senior Executive  Service (SES) leads America&rsquo;s workforce. As the keystone of the Civil Service  Reform Act of 1978, the SES was established to &ldquo;...ensure that the executive  management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs,  policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality.&rdquo;  These leaders possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective  on government and a public service commitment that is grounded in the  Constitution.</p>
<p>Members of the SES  serve in the key positions just below the top Presidential appointees. SES members  are the major link between these appointees and the rest of the federal  workforce. They operate and oversee nearly every government activity in  approximately 75 federal agencies.</p>

<p>OPM manages the  overall federal executive personnel program, providing the day-to-day oversight  and assistance to agencies as they develop, select, and manage their federal  executives.</p>
