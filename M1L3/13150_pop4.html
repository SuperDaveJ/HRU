<p>Rating involves evaluating employee or group performance against the elements and standards in an employee’s performance plan and assigning a summary rating of record. The rating of record is assigned according to procedures included in the organization’s appraisal program and is based on work performed during an entire appraisal period. The rating of record has a bearing on other personnel actions, such as within-grade pay increases and determining additional retention service credit in a reduction in force. During the rating process, supervisors use the knowledge gained from monitoring the employee's performance during the appraisal period and compare that performance against the employee's elements and standards to determine the appropriate rating. The final rating should not be a surprise to the employee, particularly when the supervisor and the employee have had numerous performance discussions during the rating period.</p>
