<p>The General Schedule  (GS) classification and pay system covers the majority of civilian white-collar  federal employees (about 1.5 million worldwide) in professional, technical,  administrative, and clerical positions.</p>
<p>GS classification  standards, qualifications, pay structure, and related human resources policies  (e.g., general staffing and pay administration policies) are administered by  OPM on a government-wide basis. Each agency classifies its GS positions and  appoints and pays its GS employees filling those positions following statutory  and OPM guidelines.</p>
<p>The General Schedule  has 15 grades--GS-1 (lowest) to GS-15 (highest). Agencies establish (classify)  the grade of each job based on the level of difficulty, responsibility, and  qualifications required.</p>

<p>Each grade has 10  step rates (steps 1-10) that are each worth approximately 3 percent of the  employee&rsquo;s salary. Within-grade step increases are based on an acceptable level  of performance and longevity (waiting periods of 1 year at steps 1-3, 2 years  at steps 4-6, and 3 years at steps 7-9). It normally takes 18 years to advance  from step 1 to step 10 within a single GS grade if an employee remains in that  single grade. However, employees with outstanding (or equivalent) performance  ratings may be considered for additional, quality step increases (maximum of  one per year).</p>

<p>A new GS employee is usually hired at step one of the applicable GS grade. However, in special circumstances, agencies may authorize a higher step rate for a newly appointed federal employee based on a special need of the agency or superior qualifications of the prospective employee. Current federal employees who move to a GS position and are not considered newly appointed may have pay set above step 1 based only on a previous federal civilian rate of pay (i.e., maximum payable rate rule) under the gaining agencyâ€™s policies.</p>

<p>GS employees may  advance to higher grades by promotion at certain intervals (generally after at  least a year), as determined by OPM regulations and qualification standards and  agency policies, up to the full promotion potential advertised in the job  announcement. After that, competition under merit system principles is  necessary to advance to a higher GS grade. Generally, a GS promotion increase  is equal to at least two steps at the GS grade immediately before promotion to  the higher GS grade.</p>
