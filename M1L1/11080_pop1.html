<p>President Theodore  Roosevelt fought to make strides for a merit based civil service  system.&nbsp;He began with setting the foundation of the Civil Service Reform  Act of 1883 and laid the foundations of the modern  federal government during his seven years as President.</p>
<p>One of President  Roosevelt's goals was the modernization, expansion, and reform of the federal  government. As part of his administration, the Civil Service Commission drafted and implemented the foundations of the modern merit system.  His reforms included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Definitions for &quot;just cause&quot; for which  an employee could be dismissed</li>
  <li>Requirements for stricter compliance of the  restrictions against political activity by federal officials</li>
  <li>Regulations forbidding disbursing officers from  paying the salaries of persons illegally appointed to civil service positions</li>
  <li>The establishment of the modern job survey in  the Federal Service</li>
  <li>Position-classification  plan based on duties</li>
