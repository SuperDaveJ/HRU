            <p>The Spoils System was a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gave government jobs to its voters as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party—as opposed to a system of awarding offices on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity.</p>
             
            <p>The term was derived from the phrase "'to the victor belong the spoils" by New York Senator William L. Marcy, referring to the victory of Andrew Jackson in the election of 1828. Jackson was not happy with the federal employees who had been around since the Washington administration and whom he considered “corrupt.” In one year, he removed nearly 10% of government employees from their positions despite there being no evidence to support their removal. The Spoils System existed for five decades, until the assassination of U.S. President Garfield by a disappointed office seeker in 1881.</p>

            <p>Two years after Garfield's assassination, reformers began demanding a civil service system, which resulted in the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. This Act stipulated that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit or ability to perform the job rather than political connections or affiliations. The Act provided for the selection of government employees through competitive examinations and made it illegal to fire or demote government employees for political reasons. It also established a Civil Service Commission to administer the civil service of the United States federal government.</p>
             
            <p>Before 1883, only 10% of the government’s 132,000 civilian employees were placed under civil service with the rest at the disposal of the party power. Today, more than 90% of the 2.7 million federal civilian employees are covered by merit systems.</p>
