<p>In the Separate phase, employees depart from the federal service, usually for another job or to retire. The term “separation” should not be taken too literally. This phase is one of transition; “separating” employees may later return to federal service, and many of them and their family members or survivors receive retirement and other benefits. For example, they may continue to receive healthcare benefits.</p>
 
	<p>Separation also involves knowledge transfer from departing employees, which can be facilitated using a variety of collaboration tools. Even if the separation is only a movement of an employee from one federal agency to another, agencies should have a process in place to facilitate knowledge transfer between the outgoing employee and his or her colleagues to ensure the continued success of the organization’s mission.</p>
