<p>Iâ€™ve worked with a particular hiring manager on a few occasions and she always complains about the quality of the applicants that we have been referring to her. The last time we worked together to fill a vacancy, I made sure to include some quality review activities. Once I received the online questionnaires completed by the applicants, I compared their resumes against their responses and adjusted the scores and placement on the certificate as appropriate. I also suggested we use an additional assessment tool to help increase the validity and quality of the candidates we referred. Since the position was going to require a lot of writing, we asked for writing samples.</p>

<p>One of the hiring managers I was working with wanted to use both delegated examining and merit promotion procedures to fill a vacancy. I understand why he wanted to do this. He wanted to ensure that he cast the widest net possible and got the best candidates for the position. I feel that to be a better strategic partner, I can serve the hiring manger better if I advise him on the most effective and efficient recruitment sources based on historical hiring patterns for that position. In this case, I looked at the data about the unused rate for certificates referred using delegated examining procedures and found that the unused rate was very high, so I suggested we use recruiting under merit promotion procedures.</p>
