    <p id="a"><strong>Agency Policies and Requirements</strong><br>
      Guidelines for how executive departments or agencies should conduct their business. These are specific to each department or agency and not usually applicable across the government.</p>
      
    <p id="b"><strong>Bill</strong><br>
      A bill is a proposed law. It may be drafted by any competent person. The Legislative Services Commission's Bill Drafting Division and Research Division draft bills at the request of the members of the General Assembly. Only a member of the General Assembly may introduce a bill - that is, present it to the General Assembly for its consideration - and that member is called the bill's introducer or sponsor.</p>

      <p id="c"><strong>Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) Council</strong><br>
     Established as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the CHCO council advises and coordinates activities of agencies on modernizing HR systems, improving the quality of HR information, and drafting, reviewing, or responding to legislation affecting HR operations and organizations.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Civil Service Commission</strong><br>
        Established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 to administer the civil service of the United States federal government. </p>
        
      <p><strong>Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)</strong><br>
        An arrangement of the rules published in the Federal Register (FR) by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government. The CFR contains regulations directing how to implement the laws in the United States Code (U.S.C.). It provides the official and complete text of agency regulations in a single publication. The CFR is arranged in a hierarchy of Titles, Volumes, Chapters, and Parts. </p>
        
      <p><strong>Competitive Examining Authority</strong><br>
        Competitive examining is the traditional method for making appointments to competitive service positions and requires adherence to title 5's competitive examining requirements. OPM may delegate authority, by agreement, to an agency to examine for all of its competitive service positions (except Administrative Law Judges). Competitive examining is generally referred to as delegated examining (DE).</p>
        
      <p><strong>Competitive Service</strong><br>
        All civilian positions in the federal government that are not specifically excepted from the civil service laws by or pursuant to statute, by the President or by OPM under Rule VI, and that are not in the Senior Executive Service (SES) or a Senior Level position (SL). </p>
        
      <p id="d"><strong>Direct Hire Authority</strong><br>
      Is given to federal agencies for filling vacancies when a critical hiring need or severe shortage of candidates exist and allows federal hiring without regard to the provisions of title 5 U.S.C. 3309 through 3318.</p>
      
      <p id="e"><strong>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</strong><br>
        The EEOC is responsible for enforcing laws that make it illegal to discriminate against an applicant or employee in both the public and private sectors.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Excepted Service</strong><br>
        Unclassified service, unclassified civil service, or positions outside of the competitive service and the Senior Executive Service (SES). Excepted service positions have been excepted from the requirements of the competitive service by statute, Executive order, or OPM regulation.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Excepted Service Appointments</strong><br>
        When OPM excepts positions from the competitive service, it places the positions in the excepted service under Schedules A, B, or C in accordance with 5 CFR part 213. These hiring authorities cover political appointments and positions for which the use of traditional competitive hiring processes is not feasible or not practical. Agencies may also have excepted service positions that are governed by other parts of the United States Code (not title 5), and are therefore not subject to OPM hiring rules.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Executive Orders (EOs)</strong><br>
        An instruction that comes directly from the President—rather than an executive agency—that implements or interprets a federal statute. It carries the same weight as a law for Executive Branch employees.</p>
        
      <p id="f"><strong>Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA)</strong><br>
        FLRA administers the labor-management relations program and establishes policies and guidance related to labor-management relations and resolving disputes.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Federal Register (FR)</strong><br>
        An official, daily, centralized publication system for presidential documents and executive branch rule and notice documents. The FR includes a record of the following documents:</p>
        <ul><li>Executive Orders and proclamations</li>
			<li>Documents of general applicability and legal effect</li>
			<li>Documents that impose a penalty</li>
			<li>Any other documents required by Congress</li>
		</ul>
        <p>You can access the FR at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.federalregister.gov/</a> <img src="sysimages/icon_leave.png"></p>

      <p><strong>Federal Wage System (FWS)</strong><br>
        A uniform pay-setting system that covers federal appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund blue-collar employees who are paid by the hour.</p>
        
      <p id="g"><strong>General Schedule (GS)</strong><br>
        Classification and pay system that covers the majority of civilian white-collar federal employees (about 1.5 million worldwide) in professional, technical, administrative, and clerical positions. </p>
        
      <p id="h"><strong>HR Professional Framework</strong><br>
        Identifies the various HR roles in the federal government and helps you think about the direction that you would like to take as you pursue a career within the HR profession.</p>
        
    <p id="j"><strong>Job Opportunity Announcement (JOA)</strong><br>
        A federal job announcement for hiring opportunities that is required to be posted on USAJOBS.</p>
        
<p id="m"><strong>Merit Promotion</strong><br>
In addition to filling positions from among members of the general public through competitive examining, agencies often reassign or promote a current employee, or transfer an employee from another agency when filling vacant positions. The process of filling positions in this manner is called merit promotion. 5 CFR 335 contains the procedures for filling competitive service positions using merit promotion procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)</strong><br>
MSPB is an agency dedicated to protecting the merit system principles and ensuring that prohibited personnel practices are not encountered in the federal workplace.</p>
  
<p id="n"><strong>Noncompetitive Appointing Authorities</strong><br>
  In addition to the use of delegated examining or merit promotion appointing authorities, an agency might choose to make use of the myriad of special noncompetitive appointing authorities to fill a competitive service job. Those individuals eligible for noncompetitive appointments are established in 5 CFR 315 Subpart F.</p>
  
<p id="o"><strong>Office of Personnel Management (OPM)</strong><br>
  OPM is responsible for several broad categories of HR management, including: recruiting, retaining, and honoring the federal workforce. OPM is responsible for: </p>
        <ul><li>Managing federal job announcement postings</li>
			<li>Conducting background investigations</li>
			<li>Upholding the merit system principles through agency oversight</li>
			<li>Managing pension benefits and insurance programs</li>
			<li>Providing training and development programs</li>
			<li>Developing, testing, and implementing new policies that relate to HR</li>
		</ul>
        
<p><strong>Office of Special Council (OSC)</strong><br>
  OSC is an independent investigative and prosecutorial agency whose mission is to safeguard the merit system principles by protecting federal employees and applicants from prohibited personnel practices, especially regarding whistleblower protection.</p>
  
<p><strong>Pocket Veto</strong><br>
  A pocket veto occurs when a bill fails to become law because the president does not sign the bill and cannot return the bill to Congress within a 10-day period because Congress is not in session.</p>
  
<p><strong>Prohibited Personnel Practices</strong><br>
  Employment-related activities that are banned in the federal workforce because they violate the merit system through some form of employment discrimination, retaliation, improper hiring practices, or failure to adhere to laws, rules, and regulations that concern the merit system principles. </p>
        
        
<p id="r"><strong>Regulations</strong><br>
  Instructions issued by departments or agencies in the executive branch. They direct the actions of the departments or agencies in enforcing the intent of the statutes enacted by Congress. Therefore, they have the force of law.</p>
  
<p><strong>Rulemaking</strong><br>
The process that executive and independent agencies use to create, or promulgate, regulations. In general, legislatures first set broad policy mandates by passing statutes, and then agencies create more detailed regulations through rulemaking.</p>
  
<p id="s"><strong>Senior Executive Service (SES)</strong><br>
Leads America’s workforce and was established to “...ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality.”</p>
  
<p><strong>Statute</strong><br>
A written law passed by Congress. A statute begins as a bill that is proposed or sponsored by a legislator in either the Senate or the House or Representatives. A bill becomes a statute after it is approved by a majority in both houses of Congress and then signed by the President.</p>
  
<p id="u"><strong>U.S. Code (U.S.C.)</strong><br>

<p id="v"><strong>Veterans’ Preference</strong><br>
Veterans' preference recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans. Veterans' preference does not guarantee veterans a job, and it does not apply to internal agency actions such as promotions, transfers, reassignments, or reinstatements.</p>
  
<p><strong>Vetoing</strong><br>
The power or right vested in one branch of a government to cancel or postpone the decisions, enactments, etc., of another branch, especially the right of a president, governor, or other chief executive to reject bills passed by legislature. </p>
